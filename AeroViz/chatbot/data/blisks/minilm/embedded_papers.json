First and introduction\nto the engineering problems related with \ufb02utter and its classi\ufb01catios is given, then we review the basics\nof bladed-disk dynamics and unsteady aerodynamics for turbomachinery. Finally the tuned \ufb02utter\nproblem is formulated and the problem of its computation a\ufb00ordable computations is adressed- The\nmain objective is to make the reader aware of the physical origin of the concepts and their implications\nbut not to provide design rules that could be readily applicable to particular designs. 1\nIntroduction\nDynamic Aeroelasticity\nElastic and aerodynamic forces interact between them to construct the discipline that is known as aeroe-\nlasticity. When unsteady e\ufb00ects are retained then aeroelastic e\ufb00ects are referred to as dynamic.", "1": "There\nare three quite di\ufb00erent aeroelastic phenomena, namely, forced response, aerodynamic instabilities and\n\ufb02utter. The objective here is to review these three concepts to focus afterward in the aeromechanic\ninstability termed as \ufb02utter. Flutter may occur in di\ufb00erent components, we will restrict ourselves here\nto bladed-disk \ufb02utter although it is possible to see \ufb02utter in other componens with or without cyclic\nsymmetry such as rotating seals, panels or vane packets for instance. Forced Response\nForced response of blades is due to the synchronous aerodynamic excitation of neighbouring blade-rows. These\nexcitations may be due to the upstream wake velocity defects (vortical perturbations) and/or to inviscid potential\npressure waves from either the preceding or following rows Hot streaks caused by combustor cams may give rise\nalso to vortical and entropy perturbations.", "2": "The excitation frequency is associated with the blade passing frequency\nand its higher or lower harmonics. The response occurs only at the crossings of the excitation frequency with\nthe natural frequencies of the bladed-disk for which the bladed-disk are responsive due to the matching of the\ncircumferential wave-length of the mode-shapes and the excitations, in other words for those modes for which the\nexcitation order is the same than the nodal diameter. Figure 1 (left) sketches how wakes coming from the preceding row impinge in the rotor and give rise\nto unsteady forces. On the right strain gage measurements of a bladed-disk subject to a clean forced\nresponse are plot. The experimental Campbell diagram shows the presence of di\ufb00erent modes represented\nby dark quasi-horizontal lines and their excitation by several engine orders.", "3": "RTO-EN-AVT-207 \n6 - 1 \n \n \nBladed Disks: Flutter   \n\n1\nIntroduction\nVKI-LS Structural Design of Aircraft Engines\n2\nForced Response\nFrequency\n30\n110\nN (%)\n70\n90\n50\nFigure 1: Scheme of the forced response working principle.

The simplest case is the vortex shedding behind a cylinder. The \ufb02ow\nseparates in the rear part due to adverse pressure gradient in the cylinder forcing the separation and oscillation\nof the \ufb02ow with a well de\ufb01ned frequency range, (St = \u03c9d/U\u221e\u22430.2). This frequency does not correlate with the\nshaft speed of the engine and the excitation is referred to as non-synchronous. Vortex shedding due to the airfoil\ntrailing edges is just a conceptual model of the origin of the physical problem but it is not a problem in practice\nsince the excitation frequency is very high since d/c \u226a1.", "5": "Engineering problems that fall under this category are\nrotating stall and bu\ufb00eting for instance. Frequency excitation does not happen at pure tones but has a broadband contribution. This may be seen\nin \ufb01gure 2 (right) where unsteady pressure measurements due to rotating stall are displayed. It may be\nappreciated the existence of several bands, not correlating with the shaft speed. The dynamic pressure\nassociated to these instabilities is of the order of the dynamic head and therefore the forces involve are\nusually very high.", "6": "However the response is not always visible since this depends on the coincidence with\na resonance. Flutter\nFlutter is de\ufb01ned as a blade response due to an asynchronous aeroelastic instability of isolated airfoils. In the same\nline that aerodynamic instabilities the presence of neighbouring blade-rows is not needed. The main di\ufb00erence\nhere is that the airfoil motion is needed to develop an unstable behaviour, in other words while bu\ufb00eting and\nrotating stall is a pure aerodynamic instability \ufb02utter is an aeroelastic stability that requires the participation of\nthe structure. 6 - 2 \nRTO-EN-AVT-207 \n \n\n3\nVKI-LS Structural Design of Aircraft Engines\n1\nIntroduction\nFlutter\nFrequency\n30\n110\nN (%)\n70\n90\n50\nFigure 3: Scheme of Flutter working principle\nT\nm\np\nChoke Flutter\nTransonic Stall Flutter\nSubsonic Stall Flutter\nSupersonic Stall Flutter\nSupersonic Unstall Flutter\n25%\n75%\n50%\n100%\nChoke Line\n\u03c0\nSurge Line\nOperating Line\nFigure 4: Classical flutter compressor map (Left) and compressor snubbers used to prevent\nflutter\nFrequency response is necessarily associated to structural modes since their participation is needed.", "7": "Figure\n? ? emphasizes that the instability may develop in a purely inviscid \ufb02ow without any kind of separation,\nbut the instability requires the presence of the structure.

Phenomenological Classi\ufb01cation and Description\nFlutter is primarily seen in in fans, front and middle compressor blades and high aspect ratio low.pressure\nturbines. Flutter is not a concern for HPT since the are made of thick, low aspect ratio blades. The types\nof \ufb02utter observed in compressor blading are usually displayed in a compressor map (see Fig. 4).", "9": "Flutter\ndoes not occur usually near the design point where compressor airfoils are operating close the nominal\nincidence, but at o\ufb00-design conditions. The most common type of \ufb02utter is stalled \ufb02utter that is seen\nin fans and front compressor stages. A standard design criterion is to require that the \ufb02utter margins is\nhigh enough to avoid it in all the operating range, however with the recent improvements in surge margin\ntoday is di\ufb03cult to provide enough \ufb02utter margin to handle engine-to-engine variation and deterioration. Supersonic unstalled \ufb02utter is easily seen in shrouded fans, however the design of shrouded fans is not a\nmodern design practice. This type of \ufb02utter tends to occur at climb conditions close to the maximum\ncorrected speed.", "10": "Choke \ufb02utter is much less common and it is restricted to rear compressor stages. Low-pressure turbine \ufb02utter may be detected in any high aspect ratio,H/c, rotor blade or vane. Flutter\nis detected in a wide envelope of the turbine operating range, but the most critical point is associated\nto Maximum Take-o\ufb00conditions where both the mechanical shaft speed and the turbine inlet pressure\nreach their maximum.

The move\nto interlock shrouds, supposed to remain tight throughout the running range, gave rise to vibration\ncharacteristics similar to the ones encountered in snubbered fans that gave rise to \ufb02utter of complex\nmodes. Figure 5 displays the rotor blade aspect ratio evolution of a family of large civil aeroengines. It may\nbe seen that in the early 90\u2019s relatively large aspect ratio were designed and manufactured and that the\ninterlock con\ufb01guration, where the rotor blades are supposed to remain in tight contact during the whole\n\ufb02ight envelope was abandoned in favour of cantilever blades welded-in-pair. The ultimate goal of welding\nthe rotor blades in pairs was to mitigate \ufb02utter e\ufb00ects by providing additional aerodynamic damping.", "12": "The drop and raise of the aspect ratio with time is associated to a combination of development problems\nin previous designs, change of design targets and improvements in prediction methodologies based in a\nmore intensive use of simulation tools. Design limitations associated to the Flutter of NGVs in the last stages of LPTs are not uncommon,\nCompressor and turbines vanes are grouped in packets to reduce manufacturing costs. The number of\nvanes per packet ranges between 3 and 10. Flutter of vanes packets has unique ingredients since vane\npackets include modes which are very close in frequency that may interact among them [1, 2]. Mathematical Classi\ufb01cation\nFlutter may be classi\ufb01ed also from a mathematical point view.", "13": "This is interesting since it helps to\ndetermine the level of modelling that it is required for each problem. Classical \ufb02utter is encounter\nwhen just a single well separated unstable mode is encounter and the aerodynamics is linear since there\nare not highly non-linear phenomena, such as shock waves or separation. The perturbed unsteady \ufb02ow\nmay be considered as a small perturbation of the mean \ufb02ow and may be computed using linear methods. This type of \ufb02utter may be seen in subsonic low-pressure turbines and compressors. Non-linear \ufb02utter happens for single-mode non-linear aerodynamics.", "14": "Most, if not all, fan and compressor\n\ufb02utter types fall under this category.

Their simulation require non-linear aerodynamic models but some\nengineering approaches based in linear analysis and experience are also possible. Coalescence \ufb02utter refers to instabilities that are caused due to the interaction among several modes .", "15": "The simplest case is the classical bending-torsion interaction that may be see in aircraft wings. The\nexistence of coalescence \ufb02utter requires the presence of high enough aerodynamic forces that may couple\nthe purely structural modes. Bladed-disks are designed to have separated mode families in terms of\nfrequency but there are cases in which this interaction is unavoidable like in vane packets where several\nstructural modes with nearly the same frequency may be found. Low density bladed-disks like fans and\npropfans may experience coupled \ufb02utter due to frequency corrections due to aerodynamics e\ufb00ects. Classical Flutter\nThe main hypotheses involved are that the \ufb02ow remains attached to the airfoil and the instability is\ninduced solely by the phase di\ufb00erence between the structure motion and the induced aerodynamics\nforces.Another implicit hypothesis is that a single mode is involved because di\ufb00erent modes are well\napart in terms of frequency, we will expand this issue latter on to properly de\ufb01ne the concept of separated\nmodes.", "16": "Bladed-disk \ufb02utter add another particularity, namely that the di\ufb00erent airfoils of the bladed-disk\ninteract aerodynamically among them. As it has already been mentioned this type of \ufb02utter may be seen\nin intermediate- and low-pressure turbines\nClassical \ufb02utter may be readily understood analysing whether the \ufb02ow extract or communicate energy to\nthe airfoil. The standard form of looking at this problem is calculating the work-per-cycle performed\nby the \ufb02uid ion the airfoil that may be expressed as\nWcycle =\nZ T\n0\nZ\n\u03a3blade\npVblade.dAdt\n(1)\nif neither the velocity of blade,Vblade(t), nor the pressure on the airfoil surface, depend on the airfoil\nposition then the work per cycle reduces to\nWcycle =\nZ T\n0\nVblade(t).F(t)dt. (2)\nLet us assume that the blade undergoes an harmonic motion, xblade = x0 sin \u03c9t, thus the blade velocity is\nVblade = \u03c9x0 cos \u03c9t, and that the blade force leads its displacement by an angle \u03c8, i.e. F = F0 sin(\u03c9t+\u03c8)\nthen the work-per-cycle is\nWcycle = \u03c9x0F0\nZ 2\u03c0/\u03c9\n0\ncos \u03c9t sin(\u03c9t + \u03c8)dt = \u03c0x0F0 sin \u03c8\n(3)\nIf \u03c8 > 0, the structure absorbs energy from the \ufb02ow and the system is unstable.", "17": "It is important to\nhighlight that \ufb02utter depends solely in the phase between the airfoil displacement and the aerodynamics\nforce. Another form of looking at the problem is by representing the forces and displacements in the complex\ndomain. In this case Wcycle = Re( \u02c6F \u02c6v) = Re( \u02c6Fi\u03c9\u02c6x) = \u2212\u03c9xRFI, and therefore the sign of the work is\ncontrolled by the imaginary part of the force which is nothing that the phase between the force and the\ndisplacement. The relationship between the work-per-cycle and the phase is illustrated in \ufb01gure 6. If a force is applied\non the airfoil and as a consequence the airfoil is displaced a positive work is performed and the structure\nabsorbs energy.", "18": "If forces and displacements are exactly in phase (\u03c8 = 0) or anti-phase (\u03c8 = \u03c0), the\nsystem is conservative and the work dissipated per cycle is null.

Di\ufb00erent asymptotic\nlimits are analysed to obtain analytical description of some of the more well known behaviours\nIntroduction\nLinear bladed-disk dynamics is computed today routinely by gas turbine manufacturers using \ufb01nite\nelement methods. Complex blade shapes and disks are discretised using automatic grid generators, the\ngoverning equations are written in discrete form and the eigenvalue problem of set of ordinary di\ufb00erential\nequations solved to obtain the natural frequencies and the mode-shapes.Frequencies are needed to relate\nthem with the shaft speed and construct Campbell diagrams and mode-shapes to derive aerodynamic\ndamping and alternate stresses. The third building block of the bladed-disk dynamics, namely, the modal\ndamping may not readily derived from FE computation and will not be addressed here.", "19": "Rotor blades are coupled with their neighbours via the structural connections that inevitably exists either\nthrough the disks, the casings in the case of stator vanes, or through the shroud rings that are included\nto sti\ufb00en the assembly. The structural coupling among di\ufb00erent rotor blades signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uences the\nnatural frequencies and mode-shapes of the assembly and need to be retained in the simulations. Analysis\nincluding just a single blade must be regarded as \ufb01rst step in the simulation process. Perfectly tuned bladed-disks exhibit cyclic symmetry. This means that the whole wheel may be split in\nN identical sectors, probably containing several airfoils as it is always the case for sectored vanes, and\nimpose cyclic boundary conditions in the periodic boundaries to reduce the computational domain from\nthe whole wheel to a single sector largely reducing the computational time require to solve the problem.", "20": "Bladed-Disk dynamics has been well reported. Here our interest here is to make a very short review of\nthe underlying concepts resorting to a simpli\ufb01ed lumped model that contains all the key ingredients. Disks, or any continuous structure with cyclic-symmetry vibrate in double nodal diameters (see Figure\n7). Nodal diameters are the locus of the points with zero displacement that traverse radially the disc. Mode-shapes with more nodal diameters have higher natural frequencies since the mode is sti\ufb00er.", "21": "As the\nexcitation frequency increases the disk may exhibit nodal circles which are points at constant radius with\nzero displacement. Bladed-Disks are constructed \ufb01xing rotor blades to a disk, either using \ufb01r-tree or dove tail attachments,\nor welding the rotor blades to the disk or even machining integral parts with disks and blades as it is\nusually the case in small compressors (Blisks).

Figure 8 displays the frequency versus the nodal diameter of a generic bladed-disk. The horizontal\nfrequency represents the frequency that would be obtained by clamping the rotor blade at the attachment\nthat does not depend on the nodal diameter since the disk is not included in the representation. The\nparabola-like curve represents the natural frequencies of the disk alone, that increase with the nodal\ndiameter. The blend between these two curves is the bladed-disk 1stfamily of modes.", "23": "It may be observed\nthat for low nodal diameters the system is dominated by disk modes, while for high nodal diameters the\nbladed-disk natural frequencies corresponds in \ufb01rst approximation with that of the rotor blade alone. The questions that arises immediately are: What does exactly mean a rigid disk? or How \ufb02exible need\nto be a disk to see the disk dynamics? or How high need to be a nodal diameter to see just the rotor\nblade dynamics? We will try to answer this question by looking at a simpli\ufb01ed bladed-disk model.", "24": "Figure 9 show the frequency versus the nodal diameter of a low-pressure turbine real bladed-disk computed\nusing a FE model.

The behaviour of the traveling wave with nodal diameter zero (black line in Fig.", "112": "29) requires further\nexplanation. It must be taken into account that a steady aerodynamic force (lift) with a spatial pattern\ncorresponding to the ND = 0 appears in the simulation. This force was not taken into account in the\ndetermination of the initial location of the airfoils and in the long run it induces an o\ufb00-set between\nthe initial and \ufb01nal position of the airfoils, rather than an oscillation in the zero nodal diameter, which\njusti\ufb01es the weird behaviour shown in the graph.

Notice\nhowever that, in any case, the vibration amplitudes of the stable waves are 2-3 orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the amplitude of the most unstable mode. Close to the saturation (30-60 periods into the simulation) the growth rates for the unstable modes\ndecrease.

This process is\nstill active even after the envelope of the physical amplitude of the blades has already reached saturation\n(about period 40).", "114": "This means that there is a non-linear process that adjusts the vibration phase of the\nairfoils at a fairly constant vibration amplitude. 6 - 30 \nRTO-EN-AVT-207 \n \n\n31\nVKI-LS Structural Design of Aircraft Engines\n5\nAdvanced Topics\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nNormalized Frequency\n0\n0.25\n0.5\n0.75\n1\nNormalized Amplitude\nBlade DOF\nFir-tree DOF\nTime\n-0.15\n-0.05\n0.05\n0.15\nAmplitude\nTime\n-1.5\n-0.5\n0.5\n1.5\nAmplitude\nFigure 30: Six-sector model: temporal harmonic content of the periodic solution\n\u221218\n\u2212180\n\u22129\n\u221290\n0\n0\n90\n180\nND \nIBPA (\nUnstable\nStable\no)\n\u22122\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\u03be (%)\nLinear \n18\n9\nFigure 31: Aerodynamic Damping for the 36-sector model\nThis conclusion is quite remarkable since although in principle it could be thought that the saturated\nsolution could be made up of a blend of the two unstable modes, the non linearity of the \ufb01r-tree \ufb01lters\nout the second and transfer its energy to the most unstable mode.

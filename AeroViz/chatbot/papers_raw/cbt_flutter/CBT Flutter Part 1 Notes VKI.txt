INTRODUCTION

Introduction
Flutter is a dynamic instability caused by the interaction of aerodynamic, elastic and
inertial forces. It therefore belongs to the class of dynamic aeroelastic phenomena, oth-
ers being buffeting or gust response, and sits in the centre of Collar’s famous triangle
of forces illustrated in Figure 1. Flutter causes uncontrolled vibration with rising am-
plitude, and when the stress in the material exceeds steady or fatigue limits, it can
ultimately lead to the destruction of the structure. Unlike gust response or buffeting,
flutter does not require any external forces. It is the result of a positive feedback mech-
anisms between deformation of the structure and resulting unsteady aerodynamic loads.
It is commonly encountered in lifting surfaces, such as aircraft wings, tails and control
surfaces and also in wind turbine blades, rotor craft, turbomachinery blades, or even
bridges. Famous examples of flutter are the first recorded flutter event of the Handley
Page airplane in 1916 and the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940.
Be-
cause of the potentially catastrophic consequences, flutter must in general be completely
eliminated by design or at least prevented from occurring within the flight envelope. A
historical review of flutter research is given, for example, by Garrick and Reed III (1981).
Figure 1: Collar’s triangle of forces
To design against flutter, the stiffness
or mass distributions of the structure or
its aerodynamics have to be changed. This
tends to result in structures which are
heavier than designs optimised for aero-
dynamic performance (the so-called aeroe-
lastic penalty). This is still a concern in
modern engineering and a lot of research
is dedicated to the improvement of mod-
elling and detection capabilities to design
flutter-free structures, develop mitigation
measures or implement automatic control
measures. While most of the early research
on flutter was performed in wind tunnels or using analytical models, modern techniques
employ high-fidelity models of structural dynamics and aerodynamics to analyse the sta-
bility of complex structures such as whole aircraft or multi-stage aero-engine compressors.
Often, neither the mechanical properties nor the aerodynamics of such complex systems
are completed understood or accurately modelled, and therefore experimental testing re-
mains a vital part of the development process.
Although flutter is a complex phenomenon, the nature of flutter and its analysis tech-
nique can be understood from the coupled structural and aerodynamic analysis of a sim-
plified two-dimensional model. This lecture will introduce such a model, the governing
equation and its stability analysis. The behaviour of the two-dimensional model is de-
scribed by a linear set of structural dynamic equations which are coupled with a linear
representation of the aerodynamic forces resulting from the structural deformations. In
this lecture, the aerodynamic analysis is restricted to steady forces, which presents a sig-
nificant limitation. When linear models for the unsteady aerodynamics are included, the
analysis is typically referred to as classical flutter analysis. In reality both structural

INTRODUCTION
dynamics and aerodynamics give rise to non-linear effects. The flow over the surface may
separate for part or all of the vibration cycle, leading to so-called stall flutter. Large
deflections, mechanical contacts or control systems may also introduce non-linearities.
Typical flutter analysis concentrates on the stability of infinitesimal small deflections,
since it is undesirable for any system to be unstable when imposed to small random
perturbations.
Often, the introduction of non-linearities at larger deflections actually
stabilises the system. This is the case, for example, in stall flutter when flow separation
limits the amplitudes and leads to periodic limit-cycle oscillations.
A discussion of unsteady forces and non-linearities is out of scope of this lecture, but
some methods for analysis with unsteady aerodynamics and non-linear effects will be
introduced in Part 2. The simplified treatment presented in the following is chosen to
demonstrate important characteristics of flutter instability and illustrate flutter analysis.

Aeroelastic formulation
2.1
Typical section
A ‘typical section model’, which represents the cross section of a wing or rotor blade
will be used to demonstrate the stability analysis. This model has historically been used
to perform flutter analyses. It is an extremely simplified case which still shares many
properties with the more complex systems found across engineering applications. The
model and nomenclature here follows closely those of
Hodges and Pierce (2011).
A
similar, more general analysis can be found in Bisplinghoff et al. (2013).
A schematic of the typical two-dimensional section model is shown in Fig. 2. The
aerofoil section is elastically mounted on a set of discrete springs. In the standard case
shown here with two degrees of freedom, these are a compression and a torsional spring
representing the structural bending and torsional stiffness of the three-dimensional wing.
The corresponding two degrees of freedom are plunging and twisting, denoted by h and θ.
The spring stiffness constants are accordingly labelled kh and kθ. The spring are mounted
on the reference point labelled xR. The chord length is denoted by c but it is common to
use semi-chord b = c/2 as a reference length.
Two more points of interest are the point where the aerodynamic forces are acting
on and the centre of mass xCM. To simplify the aerodynamic analysis, we will consider
the aerodynamic forces acting through the aerodynamic centre xAC. The offset between
the centre of mass and the reference point is defined as xR −xCM = b(e −a) = bxθ.
The incoming air is axial, such that the instantaneous incidence angle is equal to θ. This
assumption is made for simplicity of the expressions in this example but it does not
impact the generality of the results since flutter stability concerns dynamic deviations
from a given steady-state. In a real case, the wing would be at an angle of attack and θ
would represent the deviation from this angle. The generalized aerodynamic forces acting
in the two degrees of freedom are given by

Equation of motion
where MAC is the moment about the aerodynamic centre. The second line is the moment
acting on the centre of torsion. It is here referred to as a generalized force, i.e. a force
acting in the direction of the coordinate θ, to keep the notation general.
In classical
flutter, the lift and moment can be considered linear functions of the deformation (and
their derivatives), i.e. L = (dCL/dθ)θ, where the lift curve slope dCL/dθ is constant in
θ. Assuming steady flow and thin airfoil theory, they can be simplified significantly since
L = 2πρU 2bθ and MAC = 0.
2.2
Equation of motion
The equation of motion for this system for the plunge and twist degree of freedom is given
by Eq. 3. For a derivation, the reader is referred to Hodges and Pierce (2011).

where Iθ = ICM + mb2x2
θ and ICM is the moment of inertia about the centre of mass. The
mass matrix includes off-diagonal terms mbxθ crossed by inertial coupling of the plunging
and twisting motion. Because the centre of mass is located a ahead of the torsional axis,
a vertical downward acceleration ¨h is accompanied by an inertial force m¨h acting in the
upward direction through the centre of mass, which produces a positive moment about the
centre of gravity mbxθ¨h. Similarly, an angular acceleration ¨θ around the centre of torsion
xR creates a linear acceleration of mbxθ¨θ at the centre of gravity, resulting in a symmetric
mass matrix. The stiffness matrix is diagonal because the elastic forces are decoupled.
The aerodynamic forces on the right hand side are the generalized forces acting in the
two degrees of freedom, in this case lift and moment. They are more complicated and
depending on their exact nature introduce further coupling between the two degrees of
freedom, which will be seen later.
We will now make a few substitutions and manipulate the equations to arrive in a
form which is more suitable for analysis. This follows the procedure in Hodges and Pierce
(2011). Firstly, the structural stiffness will be expressed in terms of the natural frequencies
of the in-vacuo system ωh =
p
kh/m and ωθ =
p
kθ/Iθ. (These can be obtained by setting
the right hand side of Eq. 3 to zero.) Secondly, we change the plunge variable to h/b and
multiple the first equation by b.

Now, all the terms have the same units. As already mentioned, in classical flutter it is
assumed that the aerodynamic forces are linear functions of the the plunging and twisting
displacements and velocities: Fh = f(h/b, ˙h/b, θ, ˙θ), Fθ = g(h/b, ˙h/b, θ, ˙θ). Expressing
this relationship with complex coefficients, Fh = ˜Fhhh/b + ˜Fhθθ and Fθ = ˜Fθhh/b + ˜Fθθθ,
they can be further categorised into four components:
˜Fhh =
Plunging force due to plunging motion
˜Fhθ =
Plunging force due to twisting motion
˜Fθh =
Twisting force due to plunging motion
˜Fθθ =
Twisting force due to twisting motion

These force coefficients ˜F, also known as aerodynamic influence coefficients, can be inter-
preted as the unsteady aerodynamic force resulting from a unit deflection in the generalised
displacements h/b or θ. They are complex and the real part represents the component in
phase with the displacement, while the imaginary part represents the component in phase
with the velocity.

In this case, Eq. 5 is a set of linear ordinary differential equations which has general
solutions which are exponential functions of time:
h(t) = ˜heλt
θ(t) = ˜θeλt
(6)
where ˜h and ˜θ are complex amplitudes. Their real parts represent the vibration amplitudes
and their relative phases represent the phase shift between the plunging and twisting
motion, i.e. the mode shape.
To keep the notation concise, we introduce the mass M, stiffness K and aerodynamic
matrices F and the generalised displacement vector q = [h/b
θ]T = ˜qeλt:
M ¨q −[K −F]q = 0
(7)
Making the substitution q = ˜qeλt, Eq. 7 transforms into an eigenvalue problem:
λ2I −M −1[K −F] = 0

example:

Non-dimensionalisation
By analogy to a spring-damper system (¨x + 2ζω ˙x + ω2x = 0), the complex eigenvalues
relate to the critical damping ratio ζ = −Γ/ω and natural frequency of the coupled
aeroelastic system ω = Ω/
p
1 −ζ2. Typical responses for different values of Γ are shown
in Fig. 3.
Looking at Eq. 7, it is possible to split the aerodynamic forces into real and imaginary
components when moving them to the left hand side. This is done by considering that
Fq = [ℜ(F) + iℑ(F)]q = ℜ(F)q + iℑ(F) ˙q
λ since q = ˜qeλt and ˙q = ˜qλeλt = λq.
M ¨q −[ℑ(F)/λ] ˙q + [K −ℜ(F)]q = 0
(10)
In this form, it is clear that the aerodynamic forces introduce damping and modify the
effective stiffness of the system.
The last steps (from Eq. 7 apply to any aeroelastic system which can be modelled in
terms of a set of generalized displacements, not just the typical section.
2.3
Non-dimensionalisation
Equation 5 can be solved as written. However, to understand the nature and character-
istics of flutter it is more informative to express it in terms of non-dimensional variables.
The aerodynamic forces on the right hand side are functions of the aerodynamic (lift and
moment) coefficients and can be written as:
˜Fhh = ˜Chhρu2b
˜Fhθ = ˜Chθρu2b
˜Fθh = ˜Cθhρu2b2
˜Fθθ = ˜Cθθρu2b2
(11)
Substituting this into Eq. 5, manipulating the equations and identifying the non-dimensional
parameters:
Mass ratio:
µ = m/(ρπb2)
Frequency ratio:
σ = ωh/ωθ
Radius of gyration:
r =
p
Iθ/(mb2)
Reduced velocity:
V = u/(bωθ)
(12)
where m is the mass per unit span. The origin of the π in the definition of mass ratio lies
in thin airfoil theory, and the mass ratio can thus be interpreted as the ratio of the mass
of the blade to the mass of air in a circle with radius semi-chord.

Eq. 13 is the non-dimensional equation of motion for a typical aerofoil section in plunging

AEROELASTIC FORMULATION
p2I −[M ∗]−1[K∗−F ∗] = 0
(14)
where the ∗denotes the non-dimensional form of the mass, stiffness and aerodynamic
matrices. The methods which determine stability from Eq. 14 are often referred to as p
method after the non-dimensional complex eigenvalue.
Depending on the nature of the right hand side, Eq. 13 can be solved analytically.
In general, however, the aerodynamic force coefficients will be functions of the reduced
frequency of oscillation, k = fb/u, and Mach number and the system needs to be solved
iteratively. This procedure is often referred to as the p-k method (Hassig (1971)). In this
lecture, only steady aerodynamic forces will be considered.
2.4
Steady aerodynamic forces
Eq. 13 simplifies significantly if all aerodynamic forces can be calculated from steady
state formulas. In this case the angle of attack is assumed to be the instantaneous angle
of attack, i.e. θ, and there are no aerodynamic loads resulting from the plunging motion.
Assuming thin airfoil theory, this results in simple expressions for the aerodynamic force
and moment coefficients: ˜Chh = ˜Cθh = 0 and ˜Chθ = −CL = −2π and ˜Cθθ = −2π(a + 1
2).
If these are substituted in Eq. 13, the eigenvalue problem becomes:

which can be solved directly for p = λb/u giving the damping and modal frequency for a
given mass ratio, flight velocity and aerofoil geometry. This will be illustrated in Section 3.
2.5
Quasi-steady behaviour
In a more sophisticated approximation, quasi-steady behaviour is assumed. In this case,
the unsteady forces become functions of the instantaneous angle of attack θ and its first
and second derivatives, as well as the plunge velocity and acceleration:
Fhh = πρb2¨h + 2πρub˙h
(16)
Fhθ = πρb2[u ˙θ −ba¨θ] + 2πρub[uθ + b(0.5 −a) ˙θ]
(17)
Fθh = πρb3a¨h + 2πρub2(a + 0.5)˙h
(18)
Fθθ = πρb2[−ub(0.5 −a) ˙θ −b2(1/8 + a2)¨θ]
(19)
An explanation of this is out of the scope of this lecture but can be found in Bisplinghoff
et al. (2013) (Chapter 5).

COUPLED BENDING-TORSION FLUTTER

Coupled bending-torsion flutter
Figure 4: Example typical section with torsional centre located upstream of mid-chord
To demonstrate a typical flutter analysis, we will consider a specific aerofoil section
with steady aerodynamic forces as defined above. The aerodynamic centre will be placed
at quarter chord, in accordance with thin airfoil theory. Arbitrarily, we will place the
centre of mass a little upstream of mid-chord (e = −0.1) and the torsional axis further
upstream a = −0.2, as sketched in Fig. 4. We select a mass ratio µ = 20, frequency ratio
σ = 0.4 and radius of gyration r2 = 1/4. This results in a radius of gyration around the
centre of mass of r2
CM = r2 −(e −a) = 0.05.
In dimensional terms, this might be an aerofoil of chord length 1m with mass per unit
span of 15kg in an air stream of density 1kg/m3. If the torsional frequency is ωθ=100Hz,
a reduced velocity V = 2 would correspond to a dimensional velocity u=100m/s.
Assuming steady flow, the roots p of Eq. 15, will define the aeroelastic frequencies ω
(k in non-dimensional form) and aerodynamic damping ratio ζ:
p = b
U (Γ + iΩ) = b
U
h
ωζ + iω

(20)
For ζ << 1, ω = ℑ(p)U/b, and ζ = −ℜ(p)/ℑ(p). Note that k here is the inverse of reduced
velocity and therefore defined based on semi-chord and frequency in Hz. In literature it
is often also defined based on chord length and/or frequency in radians per second.
Figure 5 plots the aeroelastic frequency ω normalised by the natural frequency of the
twisting motion and the aerodynamic damping ratio ζ against the reduced velocity.
As expected, at zero velocity (in absence of aerodynamic forces) there are two indepen-
dent frequencies corresponding to one dominantly twisting and one dominantly plunging
mode. There is a small coupling between these modes because of the off-diagonal terms
in the mass matrix, introduced by the off-set of the torsional axis with respect to the
centre of mass. At this point, the real part (aerodynamic damping) is necessarily zero. As
velocity increases, the two frequencies become closer and at the flutter boundary, when
aerodynamic damping becomes negative, the two modes coalesce. This type of instabil-
ity is called a coupled bending-torsion flutter because the instability is a results of the
merging of the two original modes. The roots are now complex conjugate pairs with one
having a positive and one a negative real part.

COUPLED BENDING-TORSION FLUTTER
To further demonstrate the nature of this instability, Fig. 6 shows the corresponding
eigenvectors which describe the relative magnitude and phase of the plunge and twist
displacements at every reduced velocity. For velocities below the flutter velocity V < 1.8
there are two distinct mode shapes, Mode 1, is close to the in-vacuo plunging frequency
and the magnitude of the plunge component is much larger than that of the twist. Mode
2 is twist-dominated as expected. As the aerodynamic forces increase, the non-dominant
components of each mode grow. At the critical velocity, two coupled modes emerge. For
one of them, the twist component is lagging the plunge component while for the other
it is leading. This is illustrated in Fig. 7. Mode 1, where the twist component leads the
plunge (red lines, ϕ > 0) is positively damped as seen Fig. 5. For a case 90 degrees, the
motion is such that the aerofoil is twisting downwards at the beginning of the downward
stroke (max plunge displacement), and upward at the beginning of the upward stroke
(see Figure 8). For the other mode (Mode 2) the twist is lagging the plunge component
(blue lines, ϕ < 0). In this case, the aerofoil is twisting upwards at the beginning of the
downward stroke and downwards at the beginning of the upward stroke. This is unstable.
Figure 5: Aeroelastic frequency and aerodynamic damping as a function of reduced ve-
locity for a typical section free to move in plunge and twist
The above analysis has demonstrated how coupled bending-torsion flutter of a typical
aerofoil section occurs assuming steady aerodynamic loads. As previously mentioned, this
is a radically simplified assumption but it nevertheless provides some insights into the
mechanisms of instability (i.e. mode coupling). It can also provide some insights into the
importance of the governing non-dimensional parameters, which will be shown in the next
section.

PARAMETER DEPENDENCY

Parameter dependency
The previous section explained flutter instability of an aerofoil cross-section under the
influence of steady aerodynamic loads. The instability mechanism was shown to be caused
by coupling of the two degrees of freedom (plunge and twist). Despite its simplicity, the
typical section demonstrates the important parameters governing stability, which will now
be discussed.
From the non-dimensional form of the equation of motion Eq 15, five important pa-
rameters can be identified: reduced velocity V , mass ratio µ, frequency ratio σ, torsional
axis off-set xθ = (e −a) and the torsional axis location a. The effect of reduced velocity
has already been shown in Fig. 5 and 6. The following will investigate the influence of
the three structural parameters on stability.
4.1
Mass ratio
The mass ratio is the parameter which scales the aerodynamic forces. Figure 9 shows the
aeroelastic frequency for a range of mass ratios for the example shown above. Flutter
occurs when the two modes coalesce. It is clear that the flutter speed increases with
increasing mass ratio. The higher the mass ratio, the lower is the influence of the aero-
dynamic forces responsible for mode coupling.
For a given aircraft and speed, mass ratio will change with altitude as air density
changes. The fact that low mass ratios are more critical, suggests that the sea level flutter
boundary is lower than that at altitude. Furthermore, it shows that coupled bending-
torsion flutter is less likely to occur on wings or blades with a high mass per unit span.
Light aircraft and gliders with mass ratios <15 are more susceptible to flutter at low
reduced velocities. General aviation mass ratios at sea level are approximately 10-20,
while helicopter and aero-engine blades can reach 100 (Hodges and Pierce, 2011).
4.2
Frequency ratio
The effect of frequency ratio on the aeroelastic eigenvalues is shown in Figure 10. As
expected, increasing frequency separation delays the flutter onset. The behaviour is non-
linear and flutter velocity drops sharply as the frequency ratio approaches unity. For
σ = 1 the bending and torsion frequencies would need to be in resonance. This can only
occur for unusually high bending stiffness and unusual torsional stiffness, such that this
is usually not a concern. It is possible to intentionally design the wing or blade structure
to increase the frequency ratio and prevent coupled bending-torsion flutter.
4.3
Location of centre of mass and torsional axis
The off-diagonal terms in the mass matrix, i.e. the distance xθ = (e −a)b between the
torsional centre and the centre of mass determines the level of structural coupling between
the two modes. If xθ > 0 the centre of mass lies downstream of the torsional axis as in
the example above. If xθ < 0 the centre of mass lies upstream of the torsional axis.
Figure 11.1 shows the variation in flutter velocity for an example where the centre
of mass is fixed at e = 0 as above, and the location of the torsional centre is varied. At

a = −0.5 the torsional centre coincides with the aerodynamic centre at quarter chord, and
the matrix becomes singular. As the torsional centre shifts away from the aerodynamic
centre, the stability boundary initially moves to lower velocities because the aerodynamic
moment induced by the lift force increases, but close to the centre of mass at e = 0, the
flutter speed increases again. There is no more coupling when the centre of mass and
aerodynamic centre coincide for this simple example. Similarly, the effect of the static
unbalance, i.e. the distance between the centre of mass and the torsional axis, is shown
in Figure 11.2 for a fixed torsional axis. A large xθ increases structural coupling between
the modes.

Conclusions
This lecture has introduced the aeroelastic analysis of a typical aerofoil section with two
degrees of freedom: plunging and pitching motion. While the stability analysis, i.e. the
formulation and solution of an eigenvalue problem, is general, the results presented here
only apply to a typical section with specific structural parameters and assumes steady
aerodynamic forces. Nevertheless, a few general conclusions could be drawn:
 Under the influence of aerodynamic forces, the system’s dynamics are modified. The
aerodynamic forces change the stiffness and introduce damping.
 An instability (negative damping) arises when the bending and torsion modes be-
comes coupled under the influence of aerodynamic forces. This occurs at a critical
non-dimensional flight speed.
 For coupled bending-torsion flutter with steady aerodynamic forces, the magnitude
of the damping depends on the phase-lag between the plunging and twisting motion.
If the twisting motion leads the plunging motion, i.e. the aerofoil is pitching upwards
at the upward stroke, the system is unstable.
 For a given structure, the flutter speed increases with altitude, such that the critical
flutter condition ordinarily arises at sea level.
 A large separation between the natural frequencies of the plunging and torsion mode
delays the onset of coupled bending-torsion flutter.
Due to the assumptions made, the instabilities shown in the previous section are
limited to coupled bending-torsion instabilities and only occur at low mass ratios, when
there is some structural coupling between the modes. In reality, instability conditions are
far less restrictive. Flutter in an isolated plunge or twisting mode is possible if there is a
phase-lag between the aerodynamic forces and the structural motion, and very high mass
ratio structures such as helicopter or turbine blades can also become unstable.

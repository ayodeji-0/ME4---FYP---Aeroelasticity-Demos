VKI\n- 1 -\n\n\n1\nINTRODUCTION\n1\nIntroduction\nFlutter is a dynamic instability caused by the interaction of aerodynamic, elastic and\ninertial forces. It therefore belongs to the class of dynamic aeroelastic phenomena, oth-\ners being buffeting or gust response, and sits in the centre of Collar\u2019s famous triangle\nof forces illustrated in Figure 1. Flutter causes uncontrolled vibration with rising am-\nplitude, and when the stress in the material exceeds steady or fatigue limits, it can\nultimately lead to the destruction of the structure. Unlike gust response or buffeting,\nflutter does not require any external forces.", "48": "It is the result of a positive feedback mech-\nanisms between deformation of the structure and resulting unsteady aerodynamic loads. It is commonly encountered in lifting surfaces, such as aircraft wings, tails and control\nsurfaces and also in wind turbine blades, rotor craft, turbomachinery blades, or even\nbridges. Famous examples of flutter are the first recorded flutter event of the Handley\nPage airplane in 1916 and the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940. Be-\ncause of the potentially catastrophic consequences, flutter must in general be completely\neliminated by design or at least prevented from occurring within the flight envelope. A\nhistorical review of flutter research is given, for example, by Garrick and Reed III (1981).", "49": "Figure 1: Collar\u2019s triangle of forces\nTo design against flutter, the stiffness\nor mass distributions of the structure or\nits aerodynamics have to be changed. This\ntends to result in structures which are\nheavier than designs optimised for aero-\ndynamic performance (the so-called aeroe-\nlastic penalty). This is still a concern in\nmodern engineering and a lot of research\nis dedicated to the improvement of mod-\nelling and detection capabilities to design\nflutter-free structures, develop mitigation\nmeasures or implement automatic control\nmeasures. While most of the early research\non flutter was performed in wind tunnels or using analytical models, modern techniques\nemploy high-fidelity models of structural dynamics and aerodynamics to analyse the sta-\nbility of complex structures such as whole aircraft or multi-stage aero-engine compressors. Often, neither the mechanical properties nor the aerodynamics of such complex systems\nare completed understood or accurately modelled, and therefore experimental testing re-\nmains a vital part of the development process.", "50": "Although flutter is a complex phenomenon, the nature of flutter and its analysis tech-\nnique can be understood from the coupled structural and aerodynamic analysis of a sim-\nplified two-dimensional model. This lecture will introduce such a model, the governing\nequation and its stability analysis. The behaviour of the two-dimensional model is de-\nscribed by a linear set of structural dynamic equations which are coupled with a linear\nrepresentation of the aerodynamic forces resulting from the structural deformations. In\nthis lecture, the aerodynamic analysis is restricted to steady forces, which presents a sig-\nnificant limitation. When linear models for the unsteady aerodynamics are included, the\nanalysis is typically referred to as classical flutter analysis.", "51": "In reality both structural\nVKI\n- 3 -\n\n1\nINTRODUCTION\ndynamics and aerodynamics give rise to non-linear effects. The flow over the surface may\nseparate for part or all of the vibration cycle, leading to so-called stall flutter. Large\ndeflections, mechanical contacts or control systems may also introduce non-linearities. Typical flutter analysis concentrates on the stability of infinitesimal small deflections,\nsince it is undesirable for any system to be unstable when imposed to small random\nperturbations. Often, the introduction of non-linearities at larger deflections actually\nstabilises the system.", "52": "This is the case, for example, in stall flutter when flow separation\nlimits the amplitudes and leads to periodic limit-cycle oscillations. A discussion of unsteady forces and non-linearities is out of scope of this lecture, but\nsome methods for analysis with unsteady aerodynamics and non-linear effects will be\nintroduced in Part 2. The simplified treatment presented in the following is chosen to\ndemonstrate important characteristics of flutter instability and illustrate flutter analysis.

This model has historically been used\nto perform flutter analyses.", "53": "It is an extremely simplified case which still shares many\nproperties with the more complex systems found across engineering applications. The\nmodel and nomenclature here follows closely those of\nHodges and Pierce (2011). A\nsimilar, more general analysis can be found in Bisplinghoff et al. (2013). A schematic of the typical two-dimensional section model is shown in Fig.", "54": "2. The\naerofoil section is elastically mounted on a set of discrete springs. In the standard case\nshown here with two degrees of freedom, these are a compression and a torsional spring\nrepresenting the structural bending and torsional stiffness of the three-dimensional wing. The corresponding two degrees of freedom are plunging and twisting, denoted by h and \u03b8. The spring stiffness constants are accordingly labelled kh and k\u03b8.", "55": "The spring are mounted\non the reference point labelled xR. The chord length is denoted by c but it is common to\nuse semi-chord b = c/2 as a reference length. Two more points of interest are the point where the aerodynamic forces are acting\non and the centre of mass xCM. To simplify the aerodynamic analysis, we will consider\nthe aerodynamic forces acting through the aerodynamic centre xAC. The offset between\nthe centre of mass and the reference point is defined as xR \u2212xCM = b(e \u2212a) = bx\u03b8.", "56": "The incoming air is axial, such that the instantaneous incidence angle is equal to \u03b8. This\nassumption is made for simplicity of the expressions in this example but it does not\nimpact the generality of the results since flutter stability concerns dynamic deviations\nfrom a given steady-state. In a real case, the wing would be at an angle of attack and \u03b8\nwould represent the deviation from this angle. The generalized aerodynamic forces acting\nin the two degrees of freedom are given by\nFh = \u2212L\n(1)\nF\u03b8 = MAC + (xR \u2212xAC)L = MAC + b\n\u00121\n2 + a\n\u0013\nL\n(2)\nFigure 2: Typical section model\nVKI\n- 5 -\n\n2\nAEROELASTIC FORMULATION\n2.2\nEquation of motion\nwhere MAC is the moment about the aerodynamic centre. The second line is the moment\nacting on the centre of torsion.", "57": "It is here referred to as a generalized force, i.e. a force\nacting in the direction of the coordinate \u03b8, to keep the notation general. In classical\nflutter, the lift and moment can be considered linear functions of the deformation (and\ntheir derivatives), i.e. L = (dCL/d\u03b8)\u03b8, where the lift curve slope dCL/d\u03b8 is constant in\n\u03b8. Assuming steady flow and thin airfoil theory, they can be simplified significantly since\nL = 2\u03c0\u03c1U 2b\u03b8 and MAC = 0.", "58": "2.2\nEquation of motion\nThe equation of motion for this system for the plunge and twist degree of freedom is given\nby Eq. 3.

The\nmass matrix includes off-diagonal terms mbx\u03b8 crossed by inertial coupling of the plunging\nand twisting motion.", "59": "Because the centre of mass is located a ahead of the torsional axis,\na vertical downward acceleration \u00a8h is accompanied by an inertial force m\u00a8h acting in the\nupward direction through the centre of mass, which produces a positive moment about the\ncentre of gravity mbx\u03b8\u00a8h. Similarly, an angular acceleration \u00a8\u03b8 around the centre of torsion\nxR creates a linear acceleration of mbx\u03b8\u00a8\u03b8 at the centre of gravity, resulting in a symmetric\nmass matrix. The stiffness matrix is diagonal because the elastic forces are decoupled. The aerodynamic forces on the right hand side are the generalized forces acting in the\ntwo degrees of freedom, in this case lift and moment. They are more complicated and\ndepending on their exact nature introduce further coupling between the two degrees of\nfreedom, which will be seen later.", "60": "We will now make a few substitutions and manipulate the equations to arrive in a\nform which is more suitable for analysis. This follows the procedure in Hodges and Pierce\n(2011). Firstly, the structural stiffness will be expressed in terms of the natural frequencies\nof the in-vacuo system \u03c9h =\np\nkh/m and \u03c9\u03b8 =\np\nk\u03b8/I\u03b8.

However, to understand the nature and character-\nistics of flutter it is more informative to express it in terms of non-dimensional variables.

As expected, at zero velocity (in absence of aerodynamic forces) there are two indepen-\ndent frequencies corresponding to one dominantly twisting and one dominantly plunging\nmode. There is a small coupling between these modes because of the off-diagonal terms\nin the mass matrix, introduced by the off-set of the torsional axis with respect to the\ncentre of mass.

Mode 1, where the twist component leads the\nplunge (red lines, \u03d5 > 0) is positively damped as seen Fig. 5. For a case 90 degrees, the\nmotion is such that the aerofoil is twisting downwards at the beginning of the downward\nstroke (max plunge displacement), and upward at the beginning of the upward stroke\n(see Figure 8). For the other mode (Mode 2) the twist is lagging the plunge component\n(blue lines, \u03d5 < 0).", "77": "In this case, the aerofoil is twisting upwards at the beginning of the\ndownward stroke and downwards at the beginning of the upward stroke. This is unstable. Figure 5: Aeroelastic frequency and aerodynamic damping as a function of reduced ve-\nlocity for a typical section free to move in plunge and twist\nThe above analysis has demonstrated how coupled bending-torsion flutter of a typical\naerofoil section occurs assuming steady aerodynamic loads. As previously mentioned, this\nis a radically simplified assumption but it nevertheless provides some insights into the\nmechanisms of instability (i.e. mode coupling).", "78": "It can also provide some insights into the\nimportance of the governing non-dimensional parameters, which will be shown in the next\nsection.

The instability mechanism was shown to be caused\nby coupling of the two degrees of freedom (plunge and twist). Despite its simplicity, the\ntypical section demonstrates the important parameters governing stability, which will now\nbe discussed. From the non-dimensional form of the equation of motion Eq 15, five important pa-\nrameters can be identified: reduced velocity V , mass ratio \u00b5, frequency ratio \u03c3, torsional\naxis off-set x\u03b8 = (e \u2212a) and the torsional axis location a.", "79": "The effect of reduced velocity\nhas already been shown in Fig. 5 and 6. The following will investigate the influence of\nthe three structural parameters on stability. 4.1\nMass ratio\nThe mass ratio is the parameter which scales the aerodynamic forces. Figure 9 shows the\naeroelastic frequency for a range of mass ratios for the example shown above.", "80": "Flutter\noccurs when the two modes coalesce. It is clear that the flutter speed increases with\nincreasing mass ratio. The higher the mass ratio, the lower is the influence of the aero-\ndynamic forces responsible for mode coupling. For a given aircraft and speed, mass ratio will change with altitude as air density\nchanges. The fact that low mass ratios are more critical, suggests that the sea level flutter\nboundary is lower than that at altitude.", "81": "Furthermore, it shows that coupled bending-\ntorsion flutter is less likely to occur on wings or blades with a high mass per unit span. Light aircraft and gliders with mass ratios <15 are more susceptible to flutter at low\nreduced velocities. General aviation mass ratios at sea level are approximately 10-20,\nwhile helicopter and aero-engine blades can reach 100 (Hodges and Pierce, 2011). 4.2\nFrequency ratio\nThe effect of frequency ratio on the aeroelastic eigenvalues is shown in Figure 10. As\nexpected, increasing frequency separation delays the flutter onset.", "82": "The behaviour is non-\nlinear and flutter velocity drops sharply as the frequency ratio approaches unity. For\n\u03c3 = 1 the bending and torsion frequencies would need to be in resonance. This can only\noccur for unusually high bending stiffness and unusual torsional stiffness, such that this\nis usually not a concern. It is possible to intentionally design the wing or blade structure\nto increase the frequency ratio and prevent coupled bending-torsion flutter. 4.3\nLocation of centre of mass and torsional axis\nThe off-diagonal terms in the mass matrix, i.e.", "83": "the distance x\u03b8 = (e \u2212a)b between the\ntorsional centre and the centre of mass determines the level of structural coupling between\nthe two modes. If x\u03b8 > 0 the centre of mass lies downstream of the torsional axis as in\nthe example above. If x\u03b8 < 0 the centre of mass lies upstream of the torsional axis. Figure 11.1 shows the variation in flutter velocity for an example where the centre\nof mass is fixed at e = 0 as above, and the location of the torsional centre is varied.

There is no more coupling when the centre of mass and\naerodynamic centre coincide for this simple example. Similarly, the effect of the static\nunbalance, i.e. the distance between the centre of mass and the torsional axis, is shown\nin Figure 11.2 for a fixed torsional axis.

While the stability analysis, i.e. the\nformulation and solution of an eigenvalue problem, is general, the results presented here\nonly apply to a typical section with specific structural parameters and assumes steady\naerodynamic forces. Nevertheless, a few general conclusions could be drawn:\n\u0088 Under the influence of aerodynamic forces, the system\u2019s dynamics are modified.", "86": "The\naerodynamic forces change the stiffness and introduce damping. \u0088 An instability (negative damping) arises when the bending and torsion modes be-\ncomes coupled under the influence of aerodynamic forces. This occurs at a critical\nnon-dimensional flight speed. \u0088 For coupled bending-torsion flutter with steady aerodynamic forces, the magnitude\nof the damping depends on the phase-lag between the plunging and twisting motion. If the twisting motion leads the plunging motion, i.e.", "87": "the aerofoil is pitching upwards\nat the upward stroke, the system is unstable. \u0088 For a given structure, the flutter speed increases with altitude, such that the critical\nflutter condition ordinarily arises at sea level. \u0088 A large separation between the natural frequencies of the plunging and torsion mode\ndelays the onset of coupled bending-torsion flutter. Due to the assumptions made, the instabilities shown in the previous section are\nlimited to coupled bending-torsion instabilities and only occur at low mass ratios, when\nthere is some structural coupling between the modes. In reality, instability conditions are\nfar less restrictive.", "88": "Flutter in an isolated plunge or twisting mode is possible if there is a\nphase-lag between the aerodynamic forces and the structural motion, and very high mass\nratio structures such as helicopter or turbine blades can also become unstable.
